      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        The human digestive system is prone to suffer from many different diseases and abnormalities throughout a human
        lifetime. Some of these may be life-threatening and pose a serious risk to a patient's health and well-being. In
        most cases, if the detection of lethal disease is done early enough, it can be treated with a high chance of
        being
        fully healed. Therefore, it is important that all lesions are identified and reported during a routine
        investigation of the GI tract. Currently, the gold-standard in performing these investigations is through video
        endoscopies, which is a procedure involving a small camera attached to a tube that is inserted either orally or
        rectally. However, there is one major downside to this procedure. The method is highly dependent on the skill
        and
        experience of the person operating the endoscope, which in turn results in a high operator variation and
        performance. This is one of the reasons for high miss-rates when measuring polyp detection performance, with
        some
        miss-rates being as high as 20%. We see this as an opportunity to aid medical doctors by helping them detect
        lesions through automatic frame analysis done live during endoscopy examinations. The pattern recognition
        community has a lot of knowledge which could assist in this task, making it a perfect fit for ICPR. The work
        done
        in this competition has the potential of making a real societal impact, as it directly affects the quality of
        care
        that health-care professionals can provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge consists of three tasks, each targeting a different requirement for
        in-clinic use. The first task involves classifying images from the GI tract into 23 distinct classes. The second
        task focuses on efficiant classification measured by the amount of time spent processing each image. The last
        task relates to automatcially segmenting polyps. More information can be found on the task page.

      <h1>Dataset Details</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Labeled Images.</strong> In total, the dataset contains 10,662 labeled images stored using the JPEG
        format. The images can be found in the images folder. The classes, which each of the images belongto, correspond
        to the folder they are stored in (e.g., the "polyp" folder contains all polyp images, the "barretts" folder
        contains all images of Barrettâ€™s esophagus, etc.). The number of images per class are not balanced, which is a
        general challenge in the medical field due to the fact that some findings occur more often than others. This
        adds an additional challenge for researchers, since methods applied to the data should also be able to learn
        from a small amount of training data. The labeled images represent 23 different classes of findings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Unlabeled Images.</strong> In total, the dataset contains 99,417 unlabeled images. The unlabeled images
        can be found in the unlabeled folder which is a subfolder in the image folder, together with the other labeled
        image folders. In addition to the unlabeled image files, we also provide the extracted global features and
        cluster assignments in the Hyper-Kvasir Github repository as Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF) files. ARFF
        files can be opened and processed using, for example, the WEKA machine learning library, or they can easily be
        converted into comma-separated values (CSV) files.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Segmented Images.</strong> We provide the original image, a segmentation mask and a bounding box for
        1,000 images from the polyp class. In the mask, the pixels depicting polyp tissue, the region of interest, are
        represented by the foreground (white mask), while the background (in black) does not contain polyp pixels. The
        bounding box is defined as the outermost pixels of the found polyp. For this segmentation set, we have two
        folders, one for images and one for masks, each containing 1,000 JPEG-compressed images. The bounding boxes for
        the corresponding images are stored in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. The image and its corresponding
        mask have the same filename. The images and files are stored in the segmented images folder. It is important to
        point out that the segmented images have duplicates in the images folder of polyps since the images were taken
        from there.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Annotated Videos.</strong> The dataset contains a total of 373 videos containing different findings and
        landmarks. This corresponds to approximately 11.62 hours of videos and 1,059,519 video frames that can be
        converted to images if needed. Each video has been manually assessed by a medical professional working in the
        field of gastroenterology and resulted in a total of 171 annotated findings.
